[![unsafe forbidden](https://img.shields.io/badge/unsafe-forbidden-success.svg)](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/safety-dance/)

A tiny, highly modular, embeddable, dynamically typed scripting language with a bytecode VM, intended for use in games.

## Example

```toml
[dependences]
raton = {
  version = "0",
  features = ["i32_type", "while_loop", "single_line_comment"],
  default-features = false
}
```
```rust
// Add up all integers from 1 to n
fn sum_to_n(n) {
    let i = 0;
    let sum = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        i = i + 1;
        sum = sum + i;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

## Components
- [x] Parser
- [x] Bytecode generator
- [x] Bytecode VM
- [ ] Optimizer
- [ ] Debugger
- [ ] Modular standard library

## Modular type system
- [x] `null`
- [x] `bool` (optional `bool_type` feature)
- [x] `i32` (optional `i32_type` feature)
- [x] `f32` (optional `f32_type` feature)
- [x] `string` (optional `string_type` feature)
- [x] Host value (optional `extern_value` feature)
- [x] Host immutable/mutable reference

## Modular language features
- [x] `if`, `else` (optional `if_expression` feature)
- [x] `.method()` (optional `method_call_expression` feature)
- [x] `while`, `break`, `continue` (optional `while_loop` feature)
- [x] `//` comments (optional `single_line_comment` feature)
- [x] `/* */` comments (optional `multi_line_comment` feature)

## Serialization
- [x] `serde` (ast and bytecode)
- [x] `bitcode` (bytecode only)

## Other features

- [x] Portable to any platform, 32 bits or higher, supported by Rust
- [x] Parsing, code generation, and runtime have configurable limits
- [x] Error handling and reporting
- [x] Optional error if an operation produces `f32::NaN`
- [ ] `no_std`

## Performance

### Latency

| Operation               | Overhead    | Heap allocations (amortized) |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Create VM (4 host fn's) | 150ns       | 2                            |
| Host -> script fn call  | 50ns        | 0                            |
| Script -> host fn call  | 20ns        | 0                            |

### Throughput

Rat칩n takes ~0.4s on `Fibonacci` and ~0.05s on `1M Loop` on an i7-7700k (see [Rhai benchmarks](https://rhai.rs/book/about/benchmarks.html)).

## Security

Rat칩n is designed to handle untrusted or malicious source code, asts, or bytecode
without panicking, exhausting memory, memory unsafety, exponential time complexity,
or infinite loop. Unsafe code is forbidden, and each component has a fuzzer that
tests it against arbitrary inputs.

TODO:
- [ ] Limit length of string values

You are responsible for using the limits, such as on instructions and call stack
depth, that it provides.
